A modern, responsive classifieds web application designed to connect people within a local community to buy and sell goods and services.

## Description

LocalMart is a React-based classifieds platform where users can post advertisements for goods and services, browse listings from others in their area, and connect with sellers. The goal is to create a simple, fast, and user-friendly digital marketplace for local communities.

## Features

*   **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login for users.
*   **Ad Posting**: An easy-to-use form for users to post new classified ads with images and descriptions.
*   **Browse & Search**: A clean interface to browse, search, and filter ads by category, price, and location.
*   **Ad Management**: Users can view, edit, and delete their own ads from a personal dashboard.
*   **Responsive Design**: A seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with a modern JavaScript stack:

-   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**: For declarative routing in the application.
-   **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**: For making promise-based HTTP requests to a backend API.
-   **[React Datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/)**: A reusable date-picker component.
-   **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)**: For including popular icons in the project.

## Project Structure and File Details

The project follows a standard React application structure. Here is a detailed breakdown of the key directories and their roles:

### Root Directory (`my-app/`)

*   **`node_modules/`**: This directory contains all of the project's external dependencies (libraries and packages) downloaded by `npm` or `yarn`. It is not tracked by version control.
*   **`public/`**: This folder holds static assets that are not processed by Webpack. Files here are copied directly to the build folder.
    *   `index.html`: This is the main HTML template for the application. Your React app is injected into this page. It's the only HTML page you'll likely ever need in this Single Page Application (SPA).
    *   `favicon.ico` & `logo192.png`: These are the icons for the website, visible in browser tabs and on mobile home screens.
*   **`src/`**: This is the heart of the application, containing all the React components, logic, and styles that you will be working on.
    *   **`assets/`**: Used for storing static assets that are imported into your components, such as images, logos, fonts, and global CSS files.
        *   `index.css`: A global stylesheet for the entire application.
    *   **`components/`**: This folder contains reusable UI components that are used across different pages of the application.
        *   `AdCard.js`: A component to display a summary of a single classified ad in a list.
        *   `Header.js`: The main navigation bar at the top of the page.
        *   `SearchBar.js`: The search input field and filters.
        *   `Button.js`: A generic, stylable button component.
    *   **`pages/`** (or `views/`): These are top-level components that represent a full page or view in the application (e.g., `/home`, `/login`). They are typically composed of smaller components.
        *   `HomePage.js`: The main landing page, displaying a list of recent ads.
        *   `LoginPage.js`: The user login and registration page.
        *   `PostAdPage.js`: The form for creating a new classified ad.
        *   `AdDetailsPage.js`: A page that shows the full details of a single ad.
    *   **`services/`**: This folder is for centralizing API calls. It helps separate data-fetching logic from your UI components.
        *   `api.js`: Configures the main `axios` instance (e.g., setting the base URL for your backend API).
        *   `adService.js`: Contains functions for fetching, creating, and updating ads (e.g., `getAllAds()`, `getAdById(id)`).
    *   **`context/`**: If you are using React's Context API for global state management, this is where your context providers and consumers would live.
        *   `AuthContext.js`: Manages global authentication state (e.g., current user, login/logout functions).
    *   **`hooks/`**: For custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic.
        *   `useAuth.js`: A custom hook to easily access authentication status and functions from any component.
    *   `App.js`: This is the main application component. It's responsible for setting up the **React Router** and defining the routes for all the pages in the `pages/` directory.
    *   `index.js`: This is the **entry point** of the React application. It finds the `root` element in `public/index.html` and renders the main `App` component into it.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`, build folders).
*   **`package.json`**: This file contains project metadata, a list of all dependencies (`dependencies` and `devDependencies`), and script commands (`start`, `build`, `test`).
*   **`README.md`**: The file you are currently reading, providing documentation for the project.
